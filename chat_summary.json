The AI provided suggestions for additional features related to the themes, which were organized in a checklist format. \n\nThe user later shifted focus to backgrounds featuring toilet paper, turtles, and alligators, repeating similar requests to customize those themes. Each time, the AI responded to the user's changes with acknowledgment and promises to implement the requested designs. It highlighted options for realism versus cartoonish styles and the extent to which themes should apply across the website. The user also expressed interest in general video game aesthetics, prompting the AI to ask for further clarification on the preferred style. \n\nThroughout the conversation, the AI maintained a supportive role, confirming changes and offering potential feature enhancements that reflected the user's evolving theme preferences.",
